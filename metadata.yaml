description: In this gripping account, author Elizabeth Sandham sheds light on the
  often undesirable circumstances in which disabled children were raised in the early
  nineteenth century. Those who were lucky enough to be accepted into an asylum received
  some treatment, but those who remained at home often received minimal care and in
  some instances were treated poorly and subjected to abuse. This early tale of advocacy
  serves as powerful testimony in favor of fair treatment for children with special
  needs.
